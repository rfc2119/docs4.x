## Introduction

Some GL.iNet models support TF(MicroSD) card, some models have USB port and support USB flash drive and portable external hard drive, you can set up Samba, WebDAV, DLNA on this page for the disk.

The supported disk formats are NTFS, FAT32 and EXT.

## Supported models

Usually models with USB ports or MicroSD(TF) slots are supported for file sharing. For devices with Flash space less than or equal to 32MB, the Network Storage function is not yet supported and is still being developed and optimized.

## Insert Storage Device

For TF card, you need to power off the router first, insert the TF card and then power on the router.

For USB Drive, you can directly plug it into the USB port. For portable external hard drive, if you have a separate power supply, please connect it to the power supply.

Go to web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> Network Storage

6. Folder access link. It shows the link for Windows and Unix-link OS. The Unix-like system include Android, iOS, macOS, Ubuntu etc. Then please try to access the Samba on various OS, check out [here](#samba-client).

    **Note:** If you enabled **Allow Access Samba from WAN** and access from WAN, you need to replace the Router IP (default 192.168.8.1) in the figure below with WAN IP which can be found in the INTERNET page.
